        <p>Hello new friend! And welcome to the guild! We are a ragtag group of adventurers, 
            cooks, medics, blacksmiths, rogues, creatures, and all other sorts 
            who are dedicated to protecting the people of Phandalin!</p>
        <p>We formed seven years ago after the events of what would come to be known
            as "The Black Spider Fiasco", and have been protecting Phandalin ever since!
